        <strong>this is very important</strong>
        <p>The rain tapped gently against the window, a soft rhythm 
            that seemed to match the slow, steady thoughts drifting 
            through her mind. Outside, the world was blurred by a veil 
            of mist, the once-vibrant leaves of autumn now muted shades 
            of gold and brown sat by the fireplace, the warmth curling
             around her like a forgotten memory, and found herself lost in
              the quiet. <strong>Time felt like it was standing still</strong>, as if the rain
               had washed away the hurry of the world, leaving only the present
                moment to linger.</p>
